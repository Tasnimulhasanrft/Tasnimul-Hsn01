		<h1>Hi I am Tasnimul Hasan Rifat</h1>
		<p>I am a confident and dedicated person. Now I am studying in LLB honours at University of Asia Pacific. I wanted to learn web design and development 2-3 years back. But I couldn't make it to take a course.Finally I admitted to Shikhbe Sobai.After attending the classes I strongly believe that I can become a successful web developer. Because of our trainer and mentor Farid Rony vai's teaching style is so good and very easy to understand.</p>
